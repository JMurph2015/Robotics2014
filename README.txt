This is the readme for the BHS Robotics Team.

This repository is only to contain robot pertainent code.
Furthermore, unless you are just tweaking a value, MAKE YOUR OWN FORK.
The team captain, Joe, will manage what gets merged into the main stable code.
Joe will also manage what gets merged from the main and other forks into the competition fork.

I realize these rules sound authoritarian, but this way everyone can work in their own environment before merging things into the main fork.
This is fault protection.  This way we can test various features while still having something solid to roll back to.

Thanks,
Joe
